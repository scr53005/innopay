## 🎯 FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW

### The Merchant Back-End

The Innopay payment system revolves around a **merchant back-end** that each participating shop receives, customized to their business needs. Since the first participants are restaurants, we call these **"kitchen back-ends"**.

### Admin Dashboard

The kitchen back-end requires authentication and provides access to an **admin dashboard**. This dashboard allows the shop owner to:

- Populate their **product catalogue** (menu for restaurants)
- Add **products** (dishes, drinks for restaurants) with:
  - Prices
  - Ingredients
  - Sizes and variations
  - Allergen information

### Current Orders Page (CO Page)

The most important functionality of the kitchen back-end is the **"current orders" page** (CO page), where:

- **New orders are displayed in real time** as customers pay
- Orders appear within seconds via the merchant-hub polling infrastructure
- Staff can mark orders as transmitted to kitchen, then mark as served
- Audio alerts notify staff of new incoming orders

### Success Metric

Upon onboarding a new restaurant, the **main success indicator** is that their **CO page stays open during the restaurant's opening hours**. This ensures they:

- Are notified of new orders coming through the Innopay system
- Can fulfill orders promptly
- Maintain real-time visibility of their order queue

The CO page is the operational heart of the system — if it's open and working, the restaurant is successfully integrated into Innopay.

### Customer Front-End

Customers can access the front-end from anywhere. In the future, we plan to implement **delayed ordering** and potentially **delivery orders**. However, at this point, the main customer journey starts **inside the restaurant**.

#### The Table Experience

**Precondition**: The restaurant has placed **QR codes on the tables**.

The QR codes allow customers to:
- Access the restaurant menu and ordering system
- Automatically include table information in their orders
- Browse dishes and drinks
- Add items to a **shopping cart**
- Place orders or **call a waiter**

#### Payment-First Model

A specific feature of the Innopay system is that **an order is valid only if accompanied by payment**. Unlike typical restaurant experiences, the food and drinks are **already paid for at ordering time** rather than at the end of the meal.

**Benefits of paying in advance**:
- **Reduces risk** of customers leaving without paying
- **Reduces waiter workload** — no need to collect payment from departing customers
- **Faster service** — kitchen can start preparing immediately after payment
- **Clear order status** — paid orders are guaranteed fulfilled orders

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

The Innopay ecosystem follows a **hub-and-spokes architecture** where:

- **Hub (innopay)**: Centralized payment processor and wallet management system
- **Spokes**: Individual restaurant applications that integrate with the hub for payments

### Key Design Principles

1. **Centralized Payment Processing**: All blockchain operations and Stripe payments happen in the hub
2. **Credential Security**: Hub manages sensitive account credentials, passes them securely to spokes
3. **Spoke Independence**: Each restaurant can have unique UI/UX and features
4. **Technology Flexibility**: Spokes can use different tech stacks (Next.js, Vite, etc.)
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new restaurant spokes without modifying existing ones
6. **Efficient Blockchain Access**: Merchant-hub queries HAFSQL (structured PostgreSQL view of Hive blockchain) instead of raw blockchain, enabling fast SQL queries with O(1) scaling

## 💳 PAYMENT FLOWS

The hub-and-spokes architecture supports the following payment flows (as documented in `SPOKE-DOCUMENTATION.md`):

### Flow 3: Guest Checkout
**Trigger**: User without account places order and chooses guest checkout
**Process**:
1. Spoke redirects to hub with order details
2. Stripe payment processed (includes 5% processing fee, rounded up)
3. Hub executes blockchain transfer to restaurant
4. Returns to spoke with success parameters
5. No account created, one-time payment

**Special Notes**:
- Uses `gst` distriate tag (guest)
- Not eligible for Distriator cashback
- No blockchain account created

**Implementation Status**:
- ✅ **indiesmenu**: Fully implemented
- ✅ **croque-bedaine**: Fully implemented

**Files**: `innopay/app/api/checkout/guest/route.ts`

### Flow 4: Create Account Only / Import Credentials
**Trigger**:
- **Variant A**: User clicks "Create Wallet" without placing an order (from restaurant)
- **Variant B**: User with existing account clicks spoke card from hub (credential import)

**Process (Variant A - Create Account)**:
1. User redirected to hub with table context
2. Completes account creation and top-up
3. Returns to spoke with `session_id` parameter
4. Spoke fetches credentials via `/api/account/credentials`
5. Credentials stored in localStorage
6. MiniWallet appears with account name and balance

**Process (Variant B - Import Credentials)**:
1. Hub creates credential session via `/api/account/create-credential-session`
2. Hub adds `credential_token` + `flow=4` to spoke URL
3. Spoke detects token and fetches credentials via `/api/account/credentials`
4. Spoke stores credentials in localStorage
5. MiniWallet appears with account name and balance (no page refresh needed)

**Credential Session Utility** (2026-01-08):
- `lib/credential-session.ts` - Reusable credential import logic
- `prepareUrlWithCredentials()` - High-level orchestration function
- Used by both main hub (`app/page.tsx`) and user page (`app/user/page.tsx`)
- Eliminates code duplication (40+ lines → 3 lines)

**React Query Balance Refresh** (2026-01-09):
- `hooks/useBalance.ts` - Custom hook for automatic balance fetching
- `app/providers/QueryProvider.tsx` - React Query configuration
- Stale-while-revalidate: Cached balance shows instantly, fresh data fetches in background
- Eliminates stale balance bug after topups

**Files**:
- Hub: `innopay/lib/credential-session.ts` (shared utility)
- Hub: `innopay/hooks/useBalance.ts` (React Query balance hook)
- Hub: `innopay/app/providers/QueryProvider.tsx` (React Query provider)
- Hub: `innopay/app/user/page.tsx` (credential handover after creation)
- Hub: `innopay/app/page.tsx` (credential import when clicking spoke card + balance display)
- Hub: `innopay/app/components/MiniWallet.tsx` (cached balance styling)
- Spoke: `indiesmenu/app/menu/page.tsx:215-468` (Flow 4 detection & handling)
- Spoke: `indiesmenu/app/menu/page.tsx:2460-2503` (unified success banner)

### Flow 5: Create Account and Pay
**Trigger**: User with no account places order and chooses "Create Account & Pay"
**Process**:
1. Spoke redirects to hub with order details
2. **If account exists in wallet**: Uses existing wallet to pay (flow 5 becomes flow 6 or 7) and returns `credential_token` for spoke to import account
3. **If no account exists**: User enters account name or accepts suggested name, payment includes order + top-up
4. Hub creates account + processes Stripe payment
5. Webhook attempts to transfer HBD to restaurant using `orderMemo` for matching
6. If insufficient HBD available, webhook transfers EURO Hive Engine tokens instead and records debt in `outstanding_debt` table
7. Hub returns credentials to spoke
8. Spoke shows success banner

**Payment Structure**:
- Payment is split: part goes to user's new account, part goes to restaurant
- Two-leg transfer: Customer → innopay → Restaurant
- Debt tracking ensures innopay can settle HBD obligations with restaurants later

**Special Notes**:
- Uses `kcs` distriate tag (eligible for Distriator cashback)
- Creates blockchain account

**Architecture**: Original flow, still supported

### Flow 6: Pay with Existing Account (Two-Leg Dual-Currency)
**Trigger**: User with existing account places order (sufficient balance)
**Process**:
1. Check if sufficient EURO balance available
2. **First leg transfer**: Customer → innopay
   - HBD transfer attempt: `orderAmount * eurUsdRate` HBD
   - If insufficient HBD → record `outstanding_debt` (customer owes innopay)
   - EURO transfer (collateral): Always succeeds
   - Signs and broadcasts via `/api/sign-and-broadcast` endpoint
   - Updates mini-wallet balance in UI
3. **Second leg transfer**: innopay → restaurant
   - Calls `/api/wallet-payment` endpoint
   - HBD transfer attempt to restaurant
   - If insufficient HBD → record `outstanding_debt` (innopay owes restaurant)
   - EURO transfer (collateral): Fallback payment method
   - Uses `orderMemo` for order matching

**Payment Structure Principles**:
- Both legs attempt HBD first (preferred by restaurants for Hive transactions)
- EURO tokens serve as collateral/fallback
- Outstanding debts tracked for later HBD reconciliation
- Ensures orders are ALWAYS fulfilled even when HBD is temporarily unavailable

**Special Notes**:
- Uses `kcs` distriate tag (eligible for Distriator cashback)
- No Stripe checkout required
- Fastest payment method (immediate confirmation)

**Implementation Status**:
- ✅ **indiesmenu**: Fully implemented and working (two-leg, dual-currency)
- ✅ **croque-bedaine**: Fully implemented (two-leg, dual-currency)

**Architecture**: November 2025 - Two-leg dual-currency
**Status**: ✅ STABLE - DO NOT BREAK
**Files**: `indiesmenu/app/menu/page.tsx:1536-1783`

### Flow 7: Pay with Topup (Unified Webhook)
**Trigger**: User with account but insufficient EURO balance
**Process**:
1. Redirect to hub for Stripe checkout
2. User completes EUR topup
3. **Unified webhook** processes BOTH operations atomically:
   - **Step 1**: Execute order payment (innopay → restaurant)
     - Attempts HBD transfer with orderMemo for matching
     - If HBD insufficient → transfers EURO tokens + records debt
   - **Step 2**: Calculate change (topup - order)
   - **Step 3**: Handle change transfer
     - Positive change: Transfer change to customer (EURO + HBD attempt)
     - Negative change: Transfer deficit from customer to innopay
     - Zero change: No transfer needed
   - **Step 4**: Update database with topup record
   - **Step 5**: Create credential session with updated balance
4. Stripe redirects to: `{spoke}.innopay.lu/?order_success=true&session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`
5. Spoke detects `order_success=true` and `session_id`
6. Fetches credentials from `/api/account/credentials` using session_id
7. Clears cart and shows Flow 7 success banner
8. Updates mini-wallet with new balance (NO page reload)

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Atomic webhook processing: Order payment and balance update happen server-side in one webhook call
- HBD + EURO dual transfer: Always attempts HBD first, falls back to EURO tokens with debt recording
- Credential session: Webhook creates session with `euroBalance` = change after order payment
- Session ID lookup: Spoke uses Stripe `session_id` to fetch credentials
- Debt tracking: Records `outstanding_debt` when HBD transfers fail for later reconciliation

**Special Notes**:
- Uses `kcs` distriate tag (eligible for Distriator cashback)
- Most complex flow (atomic transaction with three outcomes: positive change, negative change, exact match)
- Minimum topup: 15€ (enforced in webhook)

**Architecture**: December 2025 - Unified webhook (single webhook handles topup + payment)
**Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION READY
**Files**:
- Hub: `innopay/app/api/webhooks/route.ts` (lines 379-589: handleFlow7UnifiedApproach)
- Spoke: `indiesmenu/app/menu/page.tsx:289-309` (Flow 7 success handling)
- Credentials API: `innopay/app/api/account/credentials/route.ts` (lines 72-92: sessionId lookup)

### Flow 8: Import Account
**Trigger**: User explicitly requests import functionality via "Import Account" button
**Process**:
1. User visits spoke without credentials
2. Clicks "Import Account"
3. Enters email address associated with existing Innopay account
4. Hub sends 6-digit verification code to the email address
5. User enters the verification code
6. If single account found: auto-imports credentials
7. If multiple accounts found: user selects which account to import
8. Credentials (account name, active/posting/memo keys) stored in localStorage
9. Page reloads — MiniWallet appears with account name and balance
10. User can now pay with account

**Implementation Status**:
- ✅ **indiesmenu**: Fully implemented with email verification
- ✅ **croque-bedaine**: Fully implemented with email verification (`ImportAccountModal.tsx`)

**Security**: Both spokes use the same multi-step email verification flow (request code → verify code → get credentials), rate-limited to 5 import attempts per session

**Hub API Endpoints Used**:
- `POST /api/verify/request-code` — sends 6-digit code to email
- `POST /api/verify/check-code` — verifies code and returns account info
- `POST /api/verify/get-credentials` — returns full credentials for selected account

**Files**:
- indiesmenu: `indiesmenu/app/menu/page.tsx:1916-2080`
- croque-bedaine: `croque-bedaine/src/components/innopay/ImportAccountModal.tsx`

**Future Enhancements Needed**:
- Rate limiting at server level
- Audit logging for import attempts

### Call Waiter
**Purpose**: Notify restaurant staff without payment
**Process**:
1. User clicks "Call Waiter" button
2. If user has account: Uses Flow 6 pattern - sign and broadcast locally
3. If guest: Redirects to hub for waiter call
4. Sends symbolic EURO transfer (0.020) with memo "Un serveur est appele TABLE X"
5. Blue notification banner appears

**Files**: `indiesmenu/app/menu/page.tsx:1100-1280`, `croque-bedaine/src/hooks/innopay/usePaymentFlow.ts:488-517`

## 🏢 HUB: INNOPAY

**Repository**: `../innopay`
**Tech Stack**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Prisma + PostgreSQL
**URL**: Production: `wallet.innopay.lu` | Dev: `localhost:3000`

### Purpose

Innopay is the **central payment hub** that handles:
- User account creation and verification
- Wallet management (Hive blockchain)
- Payment processing (Stripe for EUR, Hive for HBD)
- Credential storage and secure handover to spokes
- Balance tracking and debt reconciliation

### Key Features

#### 1. Payment Processing
- **Stripe Integration**: EUR topups via credit/debit cards
- **Hive Blockchain**: HBD transfers and EURO token transfers
- **Dual-Currency Support**: Handles both EUR and HBD seamlessly
- **Debt Tracking**: Records outstanding debts when customer transfers fail

#### 2. Account Management
- **BIP39 Seed Generation**: Secure wallet creation
- **Email Verification**: 6-digit code verification system
- **Multiple Account Support**: Users can have multiple Hive accounts
- **Credential Sessions**: Temporary secure sessions for credential handover

#### 3. API Routes

**Core Payment APIs**:
- `/api/create-checkout-session` - Stripe checkout session creation
- `/api/wallet-payment` - Hive wallet payment execution
- `/api/sign-and-broadcast` - Blockchain transaction signing
- `/api/execute-order-payment` - Complete order payment flow
- `/api/webhooks` - Stripe webhook handler (unified architecture)

**Account Management APIs**:
- `/api/create-hive-account` - New Hive account creation
- `/api/account/retrieve` - Retrieve account info

### Dynamic Spoke Registry (2026-01-08)

The hub now uses a **database-driven spoke registry** (`spoke` table) instead of hardcoded business lists:

**Spoke Registration System**:
- `id` - Unique spoke identifier (e.g., 'indies', 'croque-bedaine')
- `name` - Display name (e.g., 'Independent Café')
- `type` - Business type ('restaurant', 'shop', 'service')
- `domain_prod` / `port_dev` - Environment-specific URLs
- `path` - Spoke-specific routing (e.g., '/menu', '/')
- `attribute_name_1/2/3` - Dynamic query parameters (e.g., 'table')
- `attribute_storage_key_1/2/3` - localStorage keys for attribute values
- `image_1/2/3` - Business images for hub display
- `ready` - Production readiness flag (false = "Coming Soon" badge)
- `active` - Visibility toggle
- `has_delivery` - Future delivery support flag

**URL Building**:
```typescript
// Hub dynamically builds spoke URLs based on environment and attributes
const spokeUrl = buildSpokeUrl(spoke);
// Production:  https://indies.innopay.lu/menu?table=0
// Mobile:      http://192.168.178.55:3001/menu?table=0
// Localhost:   http://localhost:3001/menu?table=0
```

**Spoke Management**:
- SQL-based CRUD operations (see `prisma/SPOKE_MANAGEMENT.md`)
- No API routes needed - direct database access
- Easy spoke registration without code changes

## 🔄 MERCHANT HUB: HAF POLLING INFRASTRUCTURE

**Repository**: `../merchant-hub`
**Tech Stack**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + PostgreSQL (HAF) + Upstash Redis
**Deployment**: Vercel (serverless with Cron)

### Purpose

The merchant-hub is a **centralized blockchain polling service** that solves the "diabolo topology" problem. Instead of each restaurant independently polling the Hive blockchain (which would create N×3 database queries for N restaurants), merchant-hub centralizes all polling into **3 total queries** (one per currency).

**HAFSQL Architecture**: Merchant-hub queries **HAFSQL** (Hive Application Framework SQL), a PostgreSQL database that maintains a structured E/R representation of the Hive blockchain. This provides:
- **Fast SQL Queries**: Standard SQL instead of blockchain API calls
- **Indexed Access**: Efficient queries with WHERE clauses and indexes
- **Relational Model**: Transfers, blocks, operations in traditional database tables
- **Real-Time Sync**: HAFSQL automatically stays synchronized with blockchain

### Architecture: Distributed Leader Election

The merchant-hub uses a **distributed leader election** pattern where multiple restaurant co (customer-facing) pages coordinate to elect a single poller:

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│  Indies Co  │    │ Croque Co   │    │  Other Co   │
│    Page     │    │    Page     │    │   Pages     │
└──────┬──────┘    └──────┬──────┘    └──────┬──────┘
       │                  │                  │
       └──────────────────┼──────────────────┘
                          │ Redis SETNX (atomic election)
                          ▼
                  ┌───────────────┐
                  │ Merchant-Hub  │
                  │   (Poller)    │
                  └───────────────┘
                          │
                          ▼
                  ┌───────────────┐
                  │   HAF DB      │
                  │ (Hive Archive)│
                  └───────────────┘
```

**Election Process**:
1. First co page to open calls `/api/wake-up`
2. Attempts Redis `SETNX` with random collision-avoidance delay (Ethernet-like)
3. Winner becomes "poller", polls every 6 seconds
4. Losers subscribe to Redis Streams for transfer notifications
5. Poller maintains heartbeat (30s TTL)
6. If poller dies, another co page takes over

### Polling Modes

**Active Mode (6-second polling)**:
- Triggered when at least one restaurant co page is open
- Poller queries HAF database every 6 seconds
- Publishes transfers to Redis Streams
- Maintains heartbeat lock

**Sleeping Mode (5-minute polling)**:
- Vercel Cron fallback when all shops closed
- Polls every 5 minutes via `/api/cron-poll` (optimized from 1-minute)
- Only runs if no active 6-second poller detected
- Ensures transfers aren't missed overnight
- Reduced frequency to stay under Upstash free tier (500k requests/month)

### Batched Query Architecture (O(1) Scaling)

**The Scaling Problem (Old Approach)**:
```
2 restaurants × 3 currencies = 6 queries
400 restaurants × 3 currencies = 1,200 queries
Execution time: ~24 seconds at scale
```

**The Solution (Batched Queries)**:
```typescript
// ONE query for ALL restaurants per currency
const hbdResult = await pool.query(
  `SELECT id, to_account, from_account, amount, symbol, memo
   FROM hafsql.operation_transfer_table
   WHERE to_account = ANY($1)  -- ['indies.cafe', 'croque.bedaine', ...]
     AND symbol = 'HBD'
     AND id > $2
   ORDER BY id DESC
   LIMIT 100`,
  [allAccounts, minLastId]
);
```

**Performance Comparison**:

| Restaurants | Old Queries | New Queries | Improvement | Est. Time |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| 2          | 6           | 3           | 2x          | ~60ms     |
| 4          | 12          | 3           | 4x          | ~65ms     |
| 400        | 1,200       | 3           | **400x**    | ~65ms     |

**Key Insight**: Network latency (10-50ms per round-trip) dominates query execution time. By reducing from N queries to 3 queries, we eliminate the dominant cost factor.

### Multi-Environment Polling

Since batched queries scale at O(1), merchant-hub queries **ALL accounts** (prod + dev) simultaneously:

```typescript
const accounts = [
  'indies.cafe',      // Production
  'indies-test',      // Development
  'croque.bedaine',   // Production
  'croque-test'       // Development
];
// Still just 3 queries total!
```

Each transfer includes the `account` field so restaurant co pages can filter by environment if needed.

### Currency Support

**Three currencies polled**:

1. **HBD** (Hive-Backed Dollars) - Native Hive token
   - Query: `operation_transfer_table`
   - Fast native transfers
   - Base layer blockchain

2. **EURO** - Hive-Engine token
   - Query: `operation_custom_json_view`
   - Pegged to EUR (1:1)
   - Layer 2 smart contract

3. **OCLT** - Hive-Engine loyalty token
   - Query: `operation_custom_json_view`
   - Community token
   - Layer 2 smart contract

### Redis Streams Integration

**Stream Architecture (2026-01-24 Update: Single Hash Optimization)**:
```
# Streams (unchanged)
transfers:indies          → Indies restaurant transfers
transfers:croque-bedaine  → Croque restaurant transfers
system:broadcasts         → System coordination messages

# Legacy keys (still used for poller lock with TTL)
polling:poller            → Current poller identity (30s TTL)

# NEW: Single hash for all polling state (Option 3 optimization)
polling:state             → Hash containing:
  ├─ heartbeat            → Poller liveness timestamp
  ├─ mode                 → active-6s | sleeping-5min
  ├─ poller               → Current poller ID
  ├─ indies.cafe:HBD      → Last processed HBD transfer ID (prod)
  ├─ indies-test:HBD      → Last processed HBD transfer ID (dev)
  ├─ indies.cafe:EURO     → Last processed EURO transfer ID (prod)
  ├─ indies-test:EURO     → Last processed EURO transfer ID (dev)
  ├─ croque.bedaine:HBD   → Last processed HBD transfer ID (prod)
  └─ ... (all account:currency combinations)

# Benefits: 1 HGETALL + 1 HMSET per poll (down from 13 GETs + N SETs)
```

**Transfer Object Structure**:
```typescript
interface Transfer {
  id: string;                // HAF operation ID
  restaurant_id: string;     // 'indies' | 'croque-bedaine'
  to_account: string;        // 'indies.cafe' | 'indies-test' (recipient Hive account)
  from_account: string;      // Customer Hive account (sender)
  amount: string;            // Transfer amount
  symbol: 'HBD' | 'EURO' | 'OCLT';
  memo: string;              // Order details + table info
  parsed_memo?: string;      // Decoded memo
  received_at: string;       // ISO timestamp
  block_num?: number;        // Blockchain block number
}
```

**Note**: The `to_account` field (previously `account`) was standardized on 2026-01-08 to match HAFSQL database column naming and enable environment-based filtering in spokes.

### API Routes

**Coordination APIs**:
- `/api/wake-up` - Co page initialization, attempt leader election
- `/api/heartbeat` - Poller heartbeat check
- `/api/poll` - Active polling endpoint (every 6s when co page is poller)
- `/api/cron-poll` - Vercel Cron fallback (every 5min when all shops closed)

**Monitoring APIs** (future):
- `/api/status` - System health check
- `/api/metrics` - Polling statistics

### Key Features

1. **Zero Missed Transfers**: Dual-mode (active + sleeping) ensures 24/7 coverage
2. **Automatic Failover**: Poller death triggers automatic re-election
3. **Scalable**: O(1) query complexity regardless of restaurant count
4. **Environment-Agnostic**: Works in Vercel prod/preview/dev environments
5. **Memo Filtering**: Per-restaurant memo patterns (e.g., "TABLE" keyword)
6. **LastId Tracking**: Per-restaurant, per-currency cursor for deduplication
7. **Redis Optimized** (2026-01-24): Single hash state reduces requests from 16 to 2 per poll (87% reduction)
8. **Cost Efficient**: 17k Redis requests/month (97% under Upstash free tier limit)

### Technology Stack

| Category | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| Framework | Next.js 15 (serverless) |
| Language | TypeScript 5 |
| Database | PostgreSQL (HAF - Hive Application Framework) |
| Cache/Pub-Sub | Upstash Redis (serverless) |
| Deployment | Vercel Pro (10s timeout) |
| Cron | Vercel Cron (1-minute) |
| DB Driver | pg (node-postgres) |

### Configuration

**Restaurant Config** (`lib/config.ts`):
```typescript
export const RESTAURANTS: RestaurantConfig[] = [
  {
    id: 'indies',
    name: 'Indies Restaurant',
    accounts: {
      prod: 'indies.cafe',
      dev: 'indies-test'
    },
    currencies: ['HBD', 'EURO', 'OCLT'],
    memoFilters: {
      HBD: '%TABLE %',
      EURO: '%TABLE %',
      OCLT: '%TABLE %'
    }
  },
  // ... more restaurants
];
```

### Vercel Deployment Constraints

**Serverless Limitations**:
- Max execution time: 10s (Vercel Pro)
- No long-running processes
- Stateless functions
- Cold starts possible

**Solutions**:
- External triggers (co page wake-up calls)
- Redis-based coordination
- Vercel Cron for fallback
- Fast queries (<1s execution)

### Future Enhancements

**Planned**:
- [ ] `/api/status` endpoint for monitoring
- [ ] Prometheus metrics export
- [ ] Transfer confirmation/acknowledgment
- [ ] Historical transfer queries
- [ ] WebSocket streaming for real-time updates

**Scaling Beyond 400 Restaurants**:
- Current LIMIT 100 (HBD) and 1000 (tokens) handles expected volume
- If spike exceeds LIMIT, next poll (6s later) catches remainder
- Transfers delayed by seconds, not lost
- Midnight-based bounds (discussed but not implemented) as future optimization

## 🧑‍🍳 MERCHANT BACKEND: KITCHEN ORDER MANAGEMENT

The merchant backend (also called "kitchen backend" or "CO pages" - Current Orders pages) provides restaurant staff with real-time order management interfaces. Each spoke has its own merchant backend implementation that consumes transfers from the merchant-hub.

### Architecture Pattern

```
Merchant Hub (HAF Polling)
    │
    ├─ Polls HAFSQL database every 6 seconds
    ├─ Publishes transfers to Redis Streams
    │
    ▼
Redis Streams (by restaurant)
    │
    ├─ transfers:indies
    ├─ transfers:croque-bedaine
    │
    ▼
Merchant Backend (Spoke Admin Pages)
    │
    ├─ Consumes from Redis Stream (6-second interval)
    ├─ Stores transfers in local database
    ├─ Displays orders to restaurant staff
    └─ Marks orders as fulfilled
```

### Key Features

**Common to All Spokes**:
1. **Real-Time Order Display**: 6-second polling from merchant-hub
2. **Order Hydration**: Dehydrated memos expanded with menu data
3. **Dual-Currency Display**: Shows both EURO and HBD transfers for same order
4. **Fulfillment Tracking**: Mark orders as completed
5. **Audio Alerts**: Sound notifications for new orders
6. **Table Identification**: Extracts table number from memo
7. **Call Waiter Detection**: Special handling for waiter call transfers

### Indiesmenu Merchant Backend

**Location**: `indiesmenu/app/admin/`

**Pages**:
- **Current Orders** (`/admin/current_orders`): Real-time order queue with kitchen workflow
- **Order History** (`/admin/history`): Historical fulfilled orders with date grouping
- **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin`): Central hub with cards for all admin functions

**Current Orders Page Features**:
- **Distributed Poller Election**: Coordinates with merchant-hub using Redis SETNX
- **Kitchen Workflow**: Two-step fulfillment (transmit to kitchen → mark as served)
- **Order Grouping**: Groups EURO + HBD transfers for same order (dual-currency support)
- **Late Order Highlighting**: Visual alerts for orders older than 10 minutes
- **Audio Reminders**: Bell sounds every 30 seconds for untransmitted orders
- **Hydrated Display**: Shows dish names, quantities, and categorization (dish vs. drink)

**Order History Page Features**:
- **Date Grouping**: Expandable sections by day
- **Auto-Refresh**: Polls for new fulfilled orders every 10 seconds
- **Incremental Loading**: Load more history in 3-day chunks
- **Hydrated Memos**: Full menu item details with color coding

**Database Schema** (Prisma):
```typescript
model Transfer {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  from_account  String
  to_account    String
  amount        String
  symbol        String    // 'HBD', 'EURO', 'OCLT'
  memo          String
  parsed_memo   String?   // JSON hydrated memo
  received_at   DateTime  @default(now())
  fulfilled_at  DateTime? // Null = unfulfilled
}
```

**API Routes**:
- `/api/transfers/sync-from-merchant-hub` - Consume from Redis, insert to DB, ACK
- `/api/transfers/unfulfilled` - Fetch pending orders
- `/api/fulfill` - Mark order as fulfilled
- `/api/orders/history` - Fetch fulfilled orders with pagination

**Navigation**:
```
Admin Dashboard (/admin)
  ├─ Current Orders → /admin/current_orders
  │    ├─ Back to Dashboard
  │    └─ View History
  └─ Order History → /admin/history
       ├─ Back to Dashboard
       └─ View Current Orders
```

**Files**:
- `indiesmenu/app/admin/current_orders/page.tsx` - CO page (912 lines)
- `indiesmenu/app/admin/history/page.tsx` - History page (432 lines)
- `indiesmenu/app/admin/page.tsx` - Dashboard (197 lines)
- `indiesmenu/app/api/transfers/sync-from-merchant-hub/route.ts` - Sync endpoint
- `indiesmenu/app/api/transfers/unfulfilled/route.ts` - Unfulfilled orders
- `indiesmenu/app/api/fulfill/route.ts` - Fulfillment endpoint
- `indiesmenu/app/api/orders/history/route.ts` - History endpoint

### Croque-Bedaine Merchant Backend

**Location**: `croque-bedaine/src/pages/admin/`

**Pages**:
- **Current Orders** (`/admin/current-orders`): Real-time order management
- **Order History** (`/admin/order-history`): Historical order tracking
- **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin`): Central admin hub

**Key Differences from Indiesmenu**:
- **SPA Architecture**: Vite + React Router (no SSR)
- **Supabase Backend**: Uses Supabase for database instead of Prisma
- **Component-Based**: CurrentOrders.tsx component (vs. full page)
- **Order Alarm System**: Separate alarm management for untransmitted orders

**Supabase Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE transfers (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  from_account TEXT,
  to_account TEXT,
  amount TEXT,
  symbol TEXT,
  memo TEXT,
  parsed_memo TEXT,
  received_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  fulfilled_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

**Files**:
- `croque-bedaine/src/pages/admin/CurrentOrders.tsx` - CO page
- `croque-bedaine/src/pages/admin/OrderHistory.tsx` - History page
- `croque-bedaine/src/pages/admin/Dashboard.tsx` - Admin dashboard
- `croque-bedaine/src/hooks/useOrderAlarm.ts` - Order alarm logic

### Integration with Merchant Hub

**Wake-Up Protocol** (Distributed Poller Election):
1. CO page calls `/api/wake-up` on merchant-hub on page load
2. Merchant-hub attempts Redis SETNX to elect poller
3. Winner polls HAF every 6 seconds, publishes to Redis Streams
4. Losers consume from Redis Streams only

**Sync Protocol** (All CO Pages):
1. Call `/api/transfers/sync-from-merchant-hub` every 6 seconds
2. Consume transfers from Redis Stream (XREADGROUP)
3. Insert new transfers into local database
4. Acknowledge consumed messages (XACK)
5. Reload unfulfilled orders from database

**Environment Filtering**:
- Indiesmenu prod: Filters for `to_account = 'indies.cafe'`
- Indiesmenu dev: Filters for `to_account = 'indies-test'`
- Croque-bedaine prod: Filters for `to_account = 'croque.bedaine'`
- Croque-bedaine dev: Filters for `to_account = 'croque-test'`

### Memo Hydration

**Dehydrated Format** (from blockchain):
```
d:1,q:2;b:3; TABLE 5 kcs-inno-xxxx-yyyy
```

**Hydrated Format** (displayed to staff):
```json
[
  { "type": "item", "quantity": 2, "description": "Croque Monsieur", "categoryType": "dish" },
  { "type": "separator" },
  { "type": "item", "quantity": 1, "description": "Coca-Cola", "categoryType": "drink" }
]
```

**Hydration Logic** (`lib/utils.ts: hydrateMemo()`):
- Parses dehydrated memo codes (d=dish, b=beverage, s=size, q=quantity)
- Looks up dish/drink names from menu data
- Adds category type for color coding
- Handles raw fallback if parsing fails

### Order Lifecycle

```
1. Customer Payment (Spoke)
   └─> Blockchain transfer with memo
       └─> HAFSQL database (auto-indexed)
           └─> Merchant Hub (polls HAFSQL)
               └─> Redis Streams (publish)
                   └─> Merchant Backend (consume)
                       ├─> Store in local DB (unfulfilled)
                       ├─> Audio alert (new order)
                       ├─> Display to staff
                       ├─> Staff transmits to kitchen
                       └─> Staff marks as fulfilled
                           └─> Remove from current orders
                               └─> Move to history
```

### Technology Stack

| Spoke | Framework | Database | State | Styling |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------|---------|
| **Indiesmenu** | Next.js 15 | PostgreSQL + Prisma | React Hooks | Styled JSX |
| **Croque-Bedaine** | Vite 5 + React Router | Supabase | React Hooks | Tailwind CSS |

**Common Dependencies**:
- **Audio**: HTML5 Audio API for bell sounds
- **Toast Notifications**: react-toastify (indies), sonner (croque)
- **Real-time**: 6-second polling intervals
- **Hydration**: Menu data fetched from `/api/menu`

### Security Considerations

**Access Control**:
- Admin pages should be behind authentication (not currently enforced)
- Fulfillment API should validate restaurant ownership
- Redis Stream consumer groups prevent message duplication

**Future Enhancements**:
- [ ] Admin authentication/authorization
- [ ] Role-based access control (cook vs. manager)
- [ ] Fulfillment confirmation (prevent accidental dismissal)
- [ ] Print integration for kitchen printers
- [ ] WebSocket streaming (replace polling)
- [ ] Order modification/cancellation workflow
- [ ] Integration with POS systems

## 🍽️ SPOKE 1: INDIESMENU

**Repository**: `./indiesmenu` (current)
**Tech Stack**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Prisma + PostgreSQL
**URL**: Production: `menu.indies.lu` | Dev: `localhost:3001`
**Entry Point**: `/menu` — monolithic client component (`app/menu/page.tsx`, ~3200 lines, 51 `useState` hooks)

> For comprehensive spoke integration details, see [SPOKE-DOCUMENTATION.md](./SPOKE-DOCUMENTATION.md).

### Purpose

Indiesmenu is a **full-featured restaurant menu and ordering system** for Indies restaurant, with:
- Digital menu display
- Shopping cart and checkout
- Daily specials management
- Order history tracking
- Admin panel for menu management
- Multi-language support (FR)

### Architecture

Indiesmenu was the **first spoke** built, before the hub existed. Its payment logic lives in a single monolithic page component (`app/menu/page.tsx`) that manages all state via 51 individual `useState` hooks and `useCallback` refs. While functional and battle-tested in production, this architecture makes it harder to reason about state transitions compared to croque-bedaine's state machine approach (see Spoke 2 below). The monolithic pattern is not recommended for new spokes — croque-bedaine's modular hook-based architecture with a formal state machine is the reference implementation.

### Key Features

#### 1. Menu System
- **Dynamic Menu**: Fetches menu from database with 7-day cache
- **Daily Specials**: Separate management for rotating daily dishes
- **Categories**: Soups, salads, main dishes, desserts, drinks
- **Allergen Information**: Track and display allergen info
- **Image Optimization**: Automated WebP conversion and optimization
- **Print-Friendly Display**: A3 landscape printout page (`/display/printout`)

#### 2. Payment Integration with Hub

**Payment Flows**:
- **Flow 4**: Create account only (no order) - Returns credentials to spoke
- **Flow 5**: Create account + order - Returns credentials + processes payment
- **Flow 6**: Pay with existing account (two-leg dual-currency)
- **Flow 7**: Pay with topup (unified webhook architecture)
- **Flow 8**: Import existing account (email verification)

**Integration Pattern**:
```typescript
// 1. Redirect to hub with order context
window.location.href = `${hubUrl}/?restaurant=indies&amount=${total}&table=${table}&...`;

// 2. Hub processes payment and redirects back
// Return URL: menu.indies.lu/?order_success=true&session_id=...&credential_token=...

// 3. Spoke receives credentials and updates balance
const response = await fetch(`${hubUrl}/api/account/credentials`, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ credentialToken })
});
```

#### 3. State Management
- **CartContext**: Shopping cart with localStorage persistence
- **React Query**: Balance fetching with automatic caching and refetching
- **MiniWallet**: Display EURO balance, account name, quick topup
- **51 `useState` hooks**: All payment, UI, and flow state managed via individual hooks in `page.tsx`

#### 4. Admin Panel
- **Menu Management**: CRUD operations for dishes
- **Daily Specials**: Manage rotating daily menu
- **Image Management**: Upload, match, and optimize images
- **Order Fulfillment**: Mark orders as prepared/delivered
- **Cache Control**: Manual menu cache invalidation

### API Routes

**Menu APIs**:
- `/api/menu` - Full menu with caching
- `/api/dishes` - Dish CRUD operations
- `/api/daily-specials` - Daily specials management
- `/api/admin/*` - Admin panel APIs

**Integration APIs**:
- `/api/balance/euro` - Fetch balance from Hive-Engine
- `/api/currency` - Exchange rate proxy (historical — new spokes use hub's rate)
- `/api/fulfill` - Order fulfillment
- `/api/orders/history` - Order history

### Database Schema

**Core Models**:
- `Category` - Menu categories
- `Dish` - Menu items with pricing, allergens
- `Order` - Customer orders with items
- `DailySpecial` - Rotating daily menu items

### Key Components

- `app/menu/page.tsx` - Main menu page with cart and checkout (~3200 lines, 51 `useState` hooks)
- `app/context/CartContext.tsx` - Shopping cart state management
- `hooks/useBalance.ts` - React Query balance hook
- `app/display/printout/page.tsx` - Printer-optimized daily specials

### Features Unique to Indiesmenu

1. **Call Waiter Button**: Uses FLOW 6 architecture to notify staff
2. **Table-Based Ordering**: URL parameter `?table=X` for table tracking
3. **Daily Specials Display**: Separate page optimized for TV/print display
4. **Menu Cache Invalidation**: Auto-invalidates on dish CRUD operations
5. **Image Optimization Scripts**: Batch processing for menu images

## 🥐 SPOKE 2: CROQUE-BEDAINE

**Repository**: `../croque-bedaine`
**Tech Stack**: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Supabase
**URL**: Production: `croque-bedaine.innopay.lu` | Dev: `localhost:8080`
**Entry Point**: `/` — modular SPA with state machine architecture

> For comprehensive spoke integration details, see [SPOKE-DOCUMENTATION.md](./SPOKE-DOCUMENTATION.md).

### Purpose

Croque-Bedaine is a **modern Vite-based restaurant menu application** built with:
- Vite for fast development and building
- React 18 with TypeScript
- shadcn/ui component library
- Supabase for backend (database + auth)
- React Query for data fetching

### Architecture: State Machine + Modular Hooks

Croque-bedaine was built **after** indiesmenu and deliberately avoids the monolithic `useState`-heavy pattern. Instead, it uses a **formal state machine** (`paymentStateMachine.ts`) with `useReducer` for payment flow management:

- **8 mutually-exclusive states**: `idle`, `selecting_flow`, `redirecting`, `processing`, `success`, `error`, `account_created`, `waiter_called`
- **12 event types**: `OPEN_FLOW_SELECTOR`, `SELECT_FLOW`, `START_REDIRECT`, `RETURN_FROM_HUB`, `PROCESSING_UPDATE`, `PAYMENT_SUCCESS`, `ACCOUNT_CREATED`, `WAITER_CALLED`, `ERROR`, `RETRY`, `RESET`, `DISMISS_BANNER`
- **Discriminated union types**: Each state carries only its relevant data (e.g., `error` state has `error` string + `canRetry` flag; `success` state has `message` + `orderId`)
- **Invalid transitions are logged, not crashed**: The reducer returns the current state unchanged if a transition doesn't match

This architecture is the **recommended pattern for new spokes**. Payment logic is split across focused hooks (`usePaymentFlow`, `useInnopayCart`, `useBalance`) rather than concentrated in a single file.

### Key Differences from Indiesmenu

| Feature | Indiesmenu | Croque-Bedaine |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Framework** | Next.js 15 | Vite 5 |
| **Backend** | Self-hosted API routes | Supabase |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL + Prisma | Supabase (PostgreSQL) |
| **Rendering** | Server + Client | Client-side (SPA) |
| **Build Time** | Slower (Next.js) | Faster (Vite) |
| **UI Library** | Custom + Tailwind | shadcn/ui |
| **Routing** | Next.js file-based | React Router |
| **State Management** | 51 `useState` hooks in ~3200-line page | `useReducer` state machine + modular hooks |
| **EUR/USD Rate** | Fetched locally (historical) | Resolved by hub (no client-side fetch needed) |

### Tech Stack

**Core Dependencies**:
- `vite` - Build tool and dev server
- `react` + `react-dom` - UI framework
- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Backend integration
- `@tanstack/react-query` - Data fetching and caching

```

### Configuration

**Vite Config**:
- Dev server on port `8080`
- Fast refresh with SWC compiler
- Path alias: `@/` → `./src/`
- Component tagging for development

### Integration with Hub

Croque-bedaine integrates with the Innopay hub using a **React hook-based architecture**, distinct from indiesmenu's monolithic page approach.

**Integration Pattern**:
```typescript
// Main UI Component
CartSheet.tsx
  ├─ usePaymentFlow()      // Payment orchestration state machine
  ├─ useInnopayCart()      // Cart extensions (table, memo generation)
  └─ useBalance()          // Balance fetching and caching
```

**Key Integration Files**:

1. **`src/components/CartSheet.tsx`** (~320 lines)
   - Main cart and checkout UI component
   - Integrates all payment flows (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
   - Handles flow selection based on user state
   - Displays status banners for payment feedback (driven by state machine)

2. **`src/hooks/innopay/usePaymentFlow.ts`** (~555 lines)
   - **Flow 3 (Guest Checkout)**: POST to `/api/checkout/guest`, redirect to Stripe
   - **Flow 4 (Create Account)**: Redirect to `/user` with `choice=create`
   - **Flow 5 (Create + Pay)**: Redirect to `/user` with order context
   - **Flow 6 (Pay with Account)**: Two-leg dual-currency via hub (`/api/sign-and-broadcast` + `/api/wallet-payment`)
   - **Flow 7 (Topup + Pay)**: Redirect to `/user` with `topup_for=order`
   - **Call Waiter**: Direct 0.020 EURO transfer (symbolic notification, not an order)
   - **Return Handling**: Processes hub redirects, fetches credentials, clears cart

3. **`src/lib/innopay/paymentStateMachine.ts`** (~212 lines)
   - `paymentReducer`: Pure function handling all state transitions
   - `getBannerMessage()`: Maps state to user-facing French strings
   - `buildReturnUrl()`, `buildHubUrl()`: URL construction helpers

4. **`src/hooks/innopay/useInnopayCart.ts`** (~186 lines)
   - Table tracking (URL params → localStorage)
   - Dehydrated memo generation: `d:1,q:2;b:3; TABLE X`
   - Cart item categorization (dishes vs beverages)

5. **`src/hooks/innopay/useBalance.ts`** (~185 lines)
   - React Query-based balance fetching from Hive-Engine
   - localStorage caching with trust window support
   - Optimistic updates for Flow 6 payments

**Flow Decision Logic**:
```typescript
// CartSheet.tsx:69-96
if (hasAccount) {
  if (balance >= cartTotal) {
    // Flow 6: Pay with account (two-leg via hub)
    actions.payWithAccount(balance);
  } else {
    // Flow 7: Topup + pay (redirect to hub)
    actions.selectFlow(7);
  }
} else {
  // No account: Show flow selector (Flows 3, 4, 5 options)
  actions.openFlowSelector();
}
```

**Differences from Indiesmenu**:
- **Modular hooks** instead of monolithic page component
- **State machine** pattern for payment flows (`paymentStateMachine.ts`)
- **React Router** instead of Next.js routing
- **No local EUR/USD rate fetch** — hub resolves rate internally in `/api/wallet-payment`
- **Same hub APIs** (`/api/checkout/guest`, `/api/account/credentials`, `/user`, `/api/sign-and-broadcast`, `/api/wallet-payment`)

**Implementation Status**:
- ✅ Flow 3 (Guest Checkout): Redirect to Stripe via hub
- ✅ Flow 4 (Create Account): Credential import working
- ✅ Flow 5 (Create + Pay): Stripe checkout with account creation
- ✅ Flow 6 (Pay with Account): Two-leg dual-currency (Customer → innopay → Restaurant)
- ✅ Flow 7 (Topup + Pay): Unified webhook approach
- ✅ Flow 8 (Import Account): Multi-step email verification (`ImportAccountModal.tsx`)
- ✅ Call Waiter: Direct 0.020 EURO transfer

## 🚀 DEVELOPMENT SETUP

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (recommended: use nvm)
- PostgreSQL (for innopay and indiesmenu)
- Supabase account (for croque-bedaine)
- npm or pnpm

### Hub Setup (innopay)

```bash
cd innopay

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials:
# - POSTGRES_URL
# - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
# - STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
# - RESEND_API_KEY
# - DATABASE_URL (Prisma)

# Run database migrations
npm run migrate:dev

# Start dev server
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

### Spoke 1 Setup (indiesmenu)

```bash
cd indiesmenu

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials:
# - POSTGRES_URL
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_HUB_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Run database migrations
npm run migrate:dev

# Start dev server
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3001
```

### Spoke 2 Setup (croque-bedaine)

```bash
cd croque-bedaine

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with Supabase credentials:
# - VITE_SUPABASE_URL
# - VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

# Start dev server
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:8080
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Start Hub First**: Always run innopay before spokes
2. **Environment URLs**: Spokes will automatically detect hub URL based on environment
3. **Database Migrations**: Run migrations when switching branches or after pull
4. **Testing Payments**: Use Stripe test mode with test cards
5. **Blockchain Testing**: Set `RECIPIENT_OVERRIDE` in innopay to test without real transfers

### Testing the System

**Test Flow 4 (Create Account)**:
1. Visit `http://localhost:3001/menu?table=1`
2. Click "Create Wallet" (no order)
3. Complete account creation on hub
4. Verify credentials returned to spoke
5. Check MiniWallet displays account name

**Test Flow 6 (Pay with Account)**:
1. Ensure you have an account with EURO balance
2. Add items to cart (ensure total < balance)
3. Click "Pay with Account"
4. Verify both EURO and HBD transfers execute
5. Check balance updates correctly

**Test Flow 7 (Topup + Pay)**:
1. Add items to cart (ensure total > balance)
2. Click checkout
3. Complete Stripe payment on hub
4. Verify redirect back with success
5. Check cart cleared and balance updated

## 🔧 ANCILLARY SCRIPTS

### QR Code Generation

Each spoke contains scripts for generating QR codes that customers scan to access the restaurant menu with table information. These scripts are essential for onboarding new merchants.

**Location**: `scripts/qrcodes/` (in each spoke: indiesmenu, croque-bedaine)

**Bundle Contents**:
- **`generateqrs.py`** - Python script that generates QR codes
- **`templateQR.png`** - Template image for QR code design
- **`<spoke_name>tables.csv`** - CSV file listing table numbers/identifiers
- **`<spoke_name>uri.txt`** - URI configuration file (base URL for the spoke)

### Merchant Onboarding Workflow

As part of onboarding a new merchant, these three files must be updated/customized:

1. **Update `templateQR.png`**: Customize with restaurant branding (optional)
2. **Create `<spoke_name>tables.csv`**: List all table numbers the restaurant has
3. **Create `<spoke_name>uri.txt`**: Set the base URL for the spoke (e.g., `https://indies.innopay.lu/menu?table=`)

### Running the Script

```bash
cd scripts/qrcodes
python generateqrs.py
```

**Output**: A `.docx` file containing all QR codes, one per table.

**Next Steps**: The merchant prints and sticks the QR codes on their respective tables.

### Example Files

**`indiestables.csv`**:
```csv
1
2
3
4
5
```

**`indiesuri.txt`**:
```
https://indies.innopay.lu/menu?table=
```

**Result**: QR codes linking to:
- Table 1: `https://indies.innopay.lu/menu?table=1`
- Table 2: `https://indies.innopay.lu/menu?table=2`
- ... and so on

cd innopay

# Build command (in Vercel settings)
npm run vercel-build
# → npx prisma migrate deploy && npx prisma generate && next build

# Environment variables needed:
# - POSTGRES_URL
# - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
# - STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
# - RESEND_API_KEY
# - DATABASE_URL
# - RECIPIENT_OVERRIDE (optional, for testing)
```

**Production URL**: `wallet.innopay.lu`

#### Spoke 1 Deployment

```bash
cd indiesmenu

# Build command (in Vercel settings)
npm run vercel-build

# Environment variables needed:
# - POSTGRES_URL
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_HUB_URL=https://wallet.innopay.lu
```

**Production URL**: `indies.innopay.lu/menu`

#### Spoke 2 Deployment

```bash
cd croque-bedaine

# Build command
npm run build
# → vite build

# Environment variables needed:
# - VITE_SUPABASE_URL
# - VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
# - VITE_HUB_URL (for innopay integration, TBD)
```

**Note**: Croque-bedaine can be deployed to Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting.

### Deployment Checklist

**Before Deploying**:
- [ ] Run `npm run build` locally to check for errors
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set
- [ ] Test database migrations with `npm run migrate:deploy`
- [ ] Update Stripe webhook URLs to production
- [ ] Set `RECIPIENT_OVERRIDE` appropriately (remove for production)
- [ ] Test all payment flows in staging environment

**After Deploying**:
- [ ] Verify Stripe webhooks are receiving events
- [ ] Test end-to-end payment flows
- [ ] Check database migrations applied successfully
- [ ] Monitor error logs for issues
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness

### Database Migrations

**Automatic Migration on Deploy**:
Both innopay and indiesmenu use `vercel-build` script that runs:
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy && npx prisma generate && next build
```

This ensures database schema is updated before the app starts.

**Manual Migration** (if needed):
```bash
npm run migrate:deploy
```

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

**Balance not updating after payment**:
- Check `refetchBalance()` is being called
- Verify React Query DevTools shows fresh data
- Check console for `[useBalance]` logs

**Hub not accessible from spoke**:
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUB_URL` environment variable
- Check hub is running on correct port
- Verify CORS settings if needed

**Database migration errors**:
- Run `npx prisma generate` after pulling new migrations
- Check PostgreSQL connection string
- Verify database exists and is accessible

**Stripe webhook not working**:
- Verify webhook secret matches environment variable
- Check webhook URL is correct in Stripe dashboard
- Test with Stripe CLI: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks`

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-14
**Maintainer**: Development Team
**Questions**: Refer to individual project documentation or code comments

**New in 2026-02-14**:
- 🔄 **Outstanding debt status lifecycle extended**: Added `recovery_ongoing` status to `outstanding_debt` table. This status is set by liman (via the airlock) when a recovery action (contact_debtor, wait_for_deposit, etc.) is initiated for a defaulted debtor. Valid transitions from `recovery_ongoing`: back to `unpaid`, `withdrawal_pending`, `paid`, or `settled_out_of_band`.
- 🔄 **`/api/outstanding-debt/update-status`**: Now accepts `recovery_ongoing` in addition to `withdrawal_pending` and `settled_out_of_band`.
- 🔄 **`/api/outstanding-debt` (GET)**: Now returns debts with status `unpaid` OR `recovery_ongoing` (previously only `unpaid`), so liman's cron can process debts under recovery the same as unpaid debts.

**New in 2026-02-13**:
- 🔄 **Croque-bedaine Flow 6 upgraded to two-leg dual-currency**: Refactored from direct single-leg (Customer → Restaurant) to full hub-mediated flow (Customer → innopay → Restaurant) matching indiesmenu
  - Leg 1: EURO collateral transfer signed via hub's `/api/sign-and-broadcast`
  - Leg 2: Hub sweeps customer HBD, records `outstanding_debt`, transfers to restaurant (HBD preferred, EURO fallback)
  - EUR/USD rate resolved server-side by the hub (no client-side rate fetching needed)
- 🔄 **wallet-payment API**: `eurUsdRate` parameter now optional — hub fetches rate internally via `getEurUsdRateServerSide()` when omitted. Backward-compatible with indiesmenu.
- 🔄 **Flow 8 (Import Account)**: Documentation updated — both spokes use identical email verification flow (was incorrectly marked as "not implemented" for croque-bedaine)

**New in 2026-01-25**:
- 🔄 **Architecture Diagram Updated**: Corrected ecosystem topology diagram to match `SPOKE-DOCUMENTATION.md`
  - Shows proper flow: Spokes → Hub → Blockchain → Merchant Hub → Spoke Admins
  - Removed incorrect separation of read/write paths
  - Simplified representation for clarity
- 🔄 **Payment Flows Reorganized**: Complete flow documentation now matches `SPOKE-DOCUMENTATION.md`
  - Flow 3: Guest Checkout (now properly documented)
  - Flow 4: Create Account Only / Import Credentials (two variants clarified)
  - Flow 5: Create Account and Pay (payment structure details added)
  - Flow 6: Pay with Existing Account (two-leg dual-currency architecture explained)
  - Flow 7: Pay with Topup (unified webhook approach detailed)
  - Flow 8: Import Account (added as separate flow)
  - Call Waiter: Moved to end, clarified as non-payment flow

**New in 2026-01-24**:
- 🆕 **Redis Optimization (Option 3)**: Single hash state management in merchant-hub
  - Consolidated all polling state (heartbeat, poller, mode, lastIds) into one Redis hash
  - Reduced from 16 Redis requests/poll to 2 requests/poll (87% reduction)
  - Monthly usage: 691k → 17k requests (97% reduction)
  - Cron interval: 1 minute → 5 minutes (additional 80% savings)
  - Total savings: Stayed under Upstash 500k free tier limit
  - Architecture: `getPollingState()` (1 HGETALL) + `updatePollingState()` (1 HMSET)
- 🆕 **Environment Filtering**: Sync endpoints filter transfers by environment
  - Indiesmenu prod filters for `indies.cafe`, dev filters for `indies-test`
  - Croque-bedaine prod filters for `croque.bedaine`, dev filters for `croque-test`
  - Prevents mixed prod/dev transfers in co pages
  - Auto-detection based on `DATABASE_URL` (indiesmenu) or explicit config (croque)
- 🆕 **Co Page Integration Complete**: Both restaurants now have working admin dashboards
  - Indies: `/admin/current_orders` with Prisma database
  - Croque: `/admin/CurrentOrders` with Supabase integration
  - Real-time order updates via merchant-hub polling
  - Order hydration with menu data
  - Kitchen transmission workflow
  - Order alarm system (croque-bedaine)

**New in 2026-01-09**:
- 🆕 React Query in Innopay Hub: Automatic balance refresh on page load, eliminates stale balance bug
- 🆕 Cached Balance Styling: MiniWallet shows italic + light blue for cached balance, normal + white for fresh
- 🆕 Flow 4 Detection Fixed: Indiesmenu properly detects `flow=4` URL parameter and handles credential imports
- 🆕 Unified Success Banner: Single banner for all flows (4, 5, 6, 7) with conditional messaging
  - Flow 4: "Votre portefeuille Innopay est prêt, vous pouvez déjà commander"
  - Flows 5/6/7: "Votre commande a été transmise et est en cours de préparation"
- 🆕 Balance Auto-Refresh Architecture:
  - Innopay: `hooks/useBalance.ts` + `app/providers/QueryProvider.tsx`
  - Stale-while-revalidate pattern: Shows cached instantly, fetches fresh in background
  - No URL parameters needed - works automatically on mount

**New in 2026-01-08**:
- 🆕 Dynamic Spoke Registry: Database-driven spoke management with `spoke` table
- 🆕 `to_account` Field Standardization: Consistent naming across merchant-hub, indiesmenu, croque-bedaine
- 🆕 Credential Import Flow: Flow 4 now works when clicking spoke cards from hub
- 🆕 Credential Session Utility: Reusable `lib/credential-session.ts` eliminates duplication
- 🆕 Environment-Based Filtering: Croque-bedaine filters transfers by DEV/PROD `to_account`
- 🆕 Spoke Management: SQL-based CRUD operations documented in `prisma/SPOKE_MANAGEMENT.md`

**Previous Updates (2026-01-02)**:
- Merchant-Hub: Centralized HAF polling infrastructure with O(1) scaling
- Batched queries: 3 total queries regardless of restaurant count
- Distributed leader election for polling coordination
- Multi-environment support (prod + dev accounts polled simultaneously)
